Project Introduction:

  It is a corporate website project developed using HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 and jQuery technologies. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen the online presence of a company with a user-friendly interface combined with a modern design approach.

Used technologies:

HTML and CSS3: While HTML, which forms the basic structure of the project, determines the layout of the pages, CSS3 increases the user experience by highlighting aesthetics and style.

Bootstrap 5: The project is built on the Bootstrap 5 framework. Bootstrap offers a comprehensive set of tools for responsive design, mobile compatibility, and rapid development.

jQuery: jQuery is used to control in-page interactions and dynamic elements. This is a preferred JavaScript library to increase interaction with users and make the website more attractive.

Project Features:

Corporate Design: An aesthetic design reflecting the corporate identity of the company was used in the project.

Page Layout and Navigation: With the features offered by Bootstrap 5, a page layout that users can easily navigate has been created.

Dynamic Content with jQuery: jQuery was used to increase user interactions on the page and present dynamic content.

Fast and Responsive Design: Thanks to the rapid development opportunities provided by Bootstrap, the project is aimed to run compatible and fast on both desktop and mobile devices.
